\title{Determines optimal scaling constant for a list of CIs}
\usage{
autoscale(cis, save_as_pngs = TRUE, targetpath = "./cis")
}
\arguments{
\item{cis}{List of cis, each of which are a list containing the pixel matrices of at least the noise pattern (\code{$ci}) and if the noise patterns need to be written to PNGs, also the base image (\code{$base}).}

\item{save_as_pngs}{Boolean, when set to true, the autoscaled noise patterns will be combined with their respective base images and saved as PNGs (using the key of the list as name).}

\item{targetpath}{Optional string specifying path to save PNGs to (default: ./cis).}
}
\value{
List of scaled noise patterns and determined scaling factor.
